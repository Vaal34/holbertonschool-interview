# Rain Trapping Algorithm

This is a Python script that implements an algorithm to calculate the amount of rainwater trapped between walls.

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm works by iterating over the heights of the walls and calculating the amount of water trapped between them. It uses two pointers to keep track of the left and right walls and calculates the water level at each position.
